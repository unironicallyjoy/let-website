            from the University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria, where he obtained
            B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in 2009 and 2018, respectively. His research
            interests are broadly in neuroscience, with a specific focus on
            neurodegeneration. His current research focuses on the role heavy
            metals such as manganese, nickel, and iron, among others, play in
            triggering neurotoxicity that may impact neuronal health and pose
            significant risks for brain disorders. His PhD aims to advance our
            understanding of multifactorial interactions involving genes,
            environment, and gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of
